\chapter{Introduction} \label{chap:intro}


High performance computing describes the ability of using parallel processing in order to perform advanced application programs with a great deal of efficiency, reliability and quickness. \cite{http://searchenterpriselinux.techtarget.com/definition/high-performance-computing}
In this document is presented the study
This chapter describes the motivation behind the choice of this subject, as well as what are the subjects covered throughout the whole document and what new ideas can come from this work.
It is divided in ##XX## parts, starting with a general view on Cloud and Grid computing, since they are two major areas of interest in this project, along with virtualization and other related subjects such as hypervisors. Cloud creation and management toolkits which are available and used throughout the academic community, such as OpenNebula and more recently, OpenStack are also approached.
A possible integration of the project documented and OpenStack is discussed in a section further ahead.

\section{Dissertation Structure} \label{sec:structure}

Current Grid Computing infrastructures are generally not very flexible when it comes to the users' needs. As such, whenever it is required, the user must adapt its code to the infrastructures specifications.
On the other hand, Cloud Computing is associated with an extreme flexibility allowing the infrastructure to adapt itself to the users' requirements. Another aspect present in Cloud Computing but non-existent in Grid Computing is the Quality of Service factor, where a user can submit a job according to a certain cost or deadline.
Furthermore, there is also the elasticity component, something that is not available in Grid Computing technologies but is inherent to Cloud Computing, and is one of its flagships that may be able to cross over to grid infrastructures.
Having this in mind, this project consisted in the development of a web environment for the creation of virtual high performance computing infrastructures and the analysis of the impact these environments have in the usage of the said infrastructures.

This document covers the work undergone regarding the study, design and implementation of the project titled:

Web System For Creating And Managing Virtual High Performance Computing Environments

throughout the course of two six month semesters, the first dedicated to the study of the subject and the second to the implementation of the solution.




\section{Context - What it is this all about} \label{}

Leonard Kleinrock (part of the team that developed Arpanet, an early seed for the Internet) said in 1969:

\begin{quote}
  ``As [...] computer networks [...] grow and become sophisticated, we will probably see the spread of `computer utilities' which, like present electric and telephone utilities, will service individual homes and offices around the country.''~\cite{Buyya2009599} 
\end{quote}
	
Confirming Kleinrock's prediction, computing is migrating in a direction where people develop software for an incredible amount of people so it can be used as a service, instead of running said software on their personal computers. Different providers such as Amazon, Google, IBM and Sun Microsystems are now establishing data centers dedicated to hosting Cloud Computing\footnote{Using multiple server computers via a digital network as if they were a single computer.} applications spread around the world in order to ensure redundancy and reliability in case one of the datacenters fails. 

User requirements for Cloud services are complex and varied, so service providers need to know they can be flexible when delivering those services at the same time they keep the users clear from the infrastructure on which those services stand.

Computing services are available instantly when anyone needs them and the consumers only required to pay the providers when they actually access and use those resources. Consumers no longer have the need to invest in and maintain complex IT infrastructures and software developers are facing new challenges. They must create custom made software that will be used as a service, instead of the traditional practice of installing the software in the users' machines. Some people state this is the era of pervasive computing, where computation and information are available all the time.~\citet{ieees}

Having this in mind, FEUP has started developing a private cloud project at its Informatics center (CICA - Centro de Informática Prof. Correia de Araújo).
	
The fraction of the work covered by this document has as its objectives the automatic creation and management of virtual environments over private high performance computing infrastructures.
